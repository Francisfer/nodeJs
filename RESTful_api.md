# RESTful apis.

--> When designing apis, there is a pattern that guides us to follow the best practices.

--> What to name our endpoints, how to break down our functionality into smaller pieces are some of the guide lines provided by REST.

--> Some of them we have already been following, like endpoints being plural nouns. friends or messages.

--> They are plural nouns because they are collections, they represent collections or lists of the data that we are keeping track of.

--> We have also implement the ability to query these collections by the id of the item in that collection.

--> RESTful apis are those that follow a certain style or pattern when building http apis.

--> It stands for REpresentational State Transfer.

-> The representation and the state, both refer to how the server makes the data available.

-> Transfer refers to how the data is sent back to the user.
